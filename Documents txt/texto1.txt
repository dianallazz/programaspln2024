1. What is a hard disk?
 A hard disk is like the long-term memory of your computer, where you can store all your
 files and data to use them when you need them. It's an essential part of your PC. Think
 of it as the computer's memory that stores everything you tell it to, but unlike the main
 memory (RAM) that forgets everything when you turn off the computer, the hard disk
 keeps the information even when the computer is turned off.

 2. How does a hard disk works?
 A hard disk works by using magnetic changes on spinning disks to store and retrieve
 data. The read/write head reads and writes data, and a file system organizes it, enabling
 your computer to access the files and programs you need.

 3. What is a track?
 A "track" refers to a lane or path used to store information on a hard disk. The operating
 system uses these tracks as a means to access the data stored on the device.

 4. What is a sector?
 Each track is divided into sectors, which are the smallest storage units on a disk.
 Sectors are where the actual data, such as files and programs, is stored

 5. How the information is stored in a hard disk?
 A hard disk stores information by using changes in magnetic orientation on spinning
 disks. These changes represent binary data, and the information is organized into tracks
 and sectors. A file system helps manage and locate the stored data, and a read/write
 head is responsible for reading and writing data on the disk.
